# -Password-Strength-Indicator-

__Make password validation clear, friendly, and colorful using a symbol‑based strength indicator. Instead of a plain bar, this project uses bold, accessible symbols and colors to show how many rules your password meets at a glance.__
## “Password Length Checker”
## 🌐 Live Demo : [👋Hello and Welcome to My Website....Thanks for Visiting My Web Pages!](https://soumyajit-sasmal.github.io/-Password-Strength-Indicator-/) <br>
### ✨ Highlights

__Symbol‑based UI: ✅/❌ indicators update as you type__

__Colorful feedback: 🔴🟠🟡🟢 communicate strength instantly__

__Rule by rule clarity: Uppercase, lowercase, number, symbol, and length__

__Accessible labels: Screen‑reader friendly messages and contrasts__

__Drop‑in friendly: Easy to integrate into any form layout__

### 🎯 What It Looks Like

__Color legend:__

🔴 Very Weak (0–1 rules met)

🟠 Weak (2 rules met)

🟡 Medium (3 rules met)

🟢 Strong (4+ rules met)

Each ✅ corresponds to a rule your password satisfies.

### 🧩 Rules Checked (Default)

    At least one uppercase letter (A–Z) ✅/❌

    At least one lowercase letter (a–z) ✅/❌

    At least one number (0–9) ✅/❌

    At least one symbol (e.g., ! @ # $ % ^ & * ( ) _ + - = { } [ ] | \ : ; " ' < > , . ? /) ✅/❌

    Minimum length (commonly 8+) ✅/❌

    You can enable/disable rules or change the minimum length in configuration.
